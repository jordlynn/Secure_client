A Secure Chat Client
====================
This program will connect two ( or more ) users with one another, and using a key exchange technique all users will send the encypted data to one another.

Set up:
=======
The way this program works is everyone needs to start the program and it will begin "listening" on a port. The a single User needs to send to the other their key which they will be prompted to send as the program starts. Once sent the reciever will get both the address and the key from the intial user.

- User 1 start program put in "Server"
- User 2 start program and select "Client"
- Allow for needed data/keys to exchange
- Begin secure chat!

Current Status
==============
Key exchange now works and all the hard stuff is done! All that needs to be done now is work on the actual chat between the clients/peers.
